# Sprint 11 - Project: Oil Well Selection (ML) - OilyGiant

## Project Description

This individual project tests machine learning skills applied to a realistic business case.

**OilyGiant**, an oil extraction company, needs to identify the best locations to open **200 new oil wells** in one of three available regions, maximizing profit and minimizing risk.

---

## Objectives

- Predict the volume of reserves in new wells.
- Select the 200 wells with the highest estimated volume.
- Choose the region with the highest total profit.
- Evaluate risks using bootstrapping.

---

## Datasets

- `geo_data_0.csv`
- `geo_data_1.csv`
- `geo_data_2.csv`

Each file contains:

- `id`: Unique well identifier.
- `f0`, `f1`, `f2`: Point characteristics.
- `product`: Reserve volume (in thousands of barrels).
